    <p>
        Depending mainly on a diet of bamboo, giant pandas live in western China. They eat dozens of pounds of bamboo per day over about 12 hours of feeding, which accounts for their incredible growth from less than a pound at birth to over 200 pounds at the age of maturity. 

        Pandas play an important role in the forest ecosystem where they live. Seeds and plant matter collects on their fur, which is then deposited as they move throughout their habitat. They also climb trees and swim, which further helps disperse the seeds. 
        
        Pandas are solitary creatures, but when females are ready to mate—starting at about eight years old—they use calls and scent to attract males. Pandas typically give birth to two cubs at a time, but usually, only one cub will survive. Birth rates for pandas are very low, which combined with habitat loss and poaching, make the species a special focus of conservationists.
